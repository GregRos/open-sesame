# What is this?
I use Windows. It’s a curse, but it’s one I’ve decided to live with. 

In Windows, scripts aren’t executable files, which creates a lot of issues. You can’t get windows to open a file with a Python program, for example. Not without great difficulty, at least.

At some point, you have to come to terms that if you want to build some cool tools to make your life easier, they’re going to have to end in an `.exe`. 

And if you want to muck about with Win32 APIs, .NET is the best language to write that `.exe` in.

This repository contains a bunch of tools like that. Most of them just launch other programs.,

This particular set of “scripts” is written in F#, which is my favorite .NET language. Even though I also feel like it shot itself in the foot since day 1.
